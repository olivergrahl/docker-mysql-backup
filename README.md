# mysql-backup

Container that backs up MySQL databases to S3. The container overwrites the same S3 object every time it is run, it is recommended you turn
versioning on to retain access to previous copies.

There is an existing image available on the public registry at [sillelien/mysql-backup](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/sillelien/mysql-backup/).

## Using on Tutum

See the tutum.yml for more details.

## Backing up

To backup run:

    $ docker run -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=key -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=secret -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-west-1 -e MYSQL_HOST=127.0.0.1 -e MYSQL_USER=root -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=password sillelien/mysql-backup backup

You can provide an extra argument with a specific database to backup.

## Restoring

To restore an existing backup run:

    $ docker run -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="key" -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="secret" -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="eu-west-1" -e MYSQL_HOST=127.0.0.1 -e MYSQL_USER=root -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=password sillelien/mysql-backup restore

It is important to note that if this database already exists on your server, this process will drop it first. You can also provide an extra argument with a specific database to restore.

## Excluding Databases

You can exclude databases from backup/restore by using --exclude.

For example:

	$ docker run -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="key" -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="secret" -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="eu-west-1" -e MYSQL_HOST=127.0.0.1 -e MYSQL_USER=root -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=password sillelien/mysql-backup --exclude=some_database,another_database restore
